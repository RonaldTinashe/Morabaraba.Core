* The board consists of 24 junctions
    * They may have different names
    * But their positions remain the same
    * Their connections also remain the same
* Two junctions are connected to each other via
    * Rows
    * Columns
    * Diagonals
* They form lines where three of them have the same kind of connection.
    * For example, A1 Row A2 Row A3
* Each junction may be either empty or occupied by a cow
* A cow can be placed onto or removed from a junction
